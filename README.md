## Hello, I'm Valeryia  ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software testing engineer with 5+ years of experience and 4.5 years in banking. I mostly specialize in Web, API testing. I work with tools like Postman, Newman, New Relic, TestRail, SSMS, PL/SQL Developer, TeamCity and Git. I have experience in writing automated tests in Postman.
Since I used to work in banking, it gives me a deep understanding of fintech processes.
